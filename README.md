# Pashword
**Passwords Done Right**

<img src="/pashword.gif">

### The WHAT üò≥
Pashword is one of a kind encrypted personalized password generator/manager that does away with the need to remember passwords. Pashword generates a unique strong password for every single one of your accounts but these passwords aren't just random like the rest of the 91244 other password generators. 

### The HOW ü§î
Every Pashword is linked to your account and the website the account belongs to. Not only does this mean that you won't ever forget how to generate the pashword, but Pashword will always generate the same password for the accounts you tell it to generate them for. All of this while not storing any data, not connecting to an external server or service. All of this takes place on your device, safe and secure.

The Pashword algorithm is extensively documented with comments. You can read the `utils/pashword.ts` file to know more about it.

Anyway, here's a rough diagram:

# Development

Just clone the repository, do an `npm install` and an `npm run dev` to run a development server.

# Credits

This obviously wouldn't have been possible without the people who helped me with the code review and suggested new ideas for the algorithm. I'm deeply grateful to have an army of big brain people who contributed to the completion of this project. Thanks to nsrCodes, TGS963, dsx724, coyotium and everybody else who has helped me with this project :)
